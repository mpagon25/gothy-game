# Gothy - Game
[Link Deploy](http://github.com)


## Description
Side scroll platformer with a bat as a protagonist who's goal it is to reach its cave.
This program/game will allow the user to maneuver a certain object through a 2D designed level and will be finished/the user wins the game when the object reaches the end of the level.

If the user lets the object collide with the enviroment or any other obstacle while flying the user loses one attempt(life).  But the user is able to land on certain obstacles. If the object collides with the bottom of the level (falls down) without landing on a platform, the user loses a life.

After losing all 3 attempts/lifes, the user lost the game and will be led to the restart screen, where the user can either restart or exit the game and will be directed to the main/splash screen.

The let the object fly, the user has to press a certain button to give the object an uplifting push otherwise the objec is constantly falling until it reaches the bottom of the level or a ground to land on. Every use of the "fly" skill consumes energy which is displayed on the sceen in form of a bar. Is the bar is empty, so is the object not able to use the fly skill anymore.

To fill the up the energy, the obeject got to consume/ "eat"  

The user will need a keyboard to start, control and end this program/game. It's designed to run on a desktop browser.


## MVP

As a user I want to see the splash screen with a start image as I open/run/enter the site/game with a button which is actually starting the program/game.

As a user I want to be able to:
- control and maneuver the object
- win by reaching the end of the level
- lose by hitting the edges of the level or any other obstacle (not bugs)

As a user I want to see the restart game screen with the last state of the game and two buttons ('restart game' and 'quit') (won|lost) as I won or lost the game.
